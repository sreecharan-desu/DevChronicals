## INTRO TO HTTP & NODEJS

    Node Js is a runtime writtern in c / c++
    But Node JS is not a Language

    'Bun' is a new langauage that is written in Zig which is a competetor for the Node JS


    What can you do with Node JS

    -> Can Create Command Line Interfaces ( Clis )
    -> Can create games 
    -> can create HTTP Servers (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)




    We Maily Focus on Creating The HTTP Servers with the Node JS



    ** Protocol -> Machines to communicate 
        Ex : Communication of Frontend and Backend



    HTTP Server  - Some Code that follows (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)

    Things that happen after searching
    (Frontend)
    -> Froms URL
    -> Domain name service resolution ( DNS resolution )
    -> Frontend & Backend Handshake


    Things that happen after searching
    (Backend)
    -> Recieve Input
    -> Do Somethings on that input
    -> Returns output
