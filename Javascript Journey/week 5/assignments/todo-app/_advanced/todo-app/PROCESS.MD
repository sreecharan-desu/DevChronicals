# Backend
 ## Coding...
    -> Intialized the node project
    -> Installed the dependencies
    -> Ready to code
    -> Coded user & admin routes
    -> Partially Completed coding user routes
        -> Remaining UpdateTodo & DeleteTodo Functionalities
        -> Completed UpdateTodo Functionality
    -> Completed User Functionaliti
    

 ## Debugging
    -> username repetition problem
    -> `Resolved`
        -> reason :
            we are searching for the user with both username & password of serching just by username in the `findOne` filter
    -> Problem at adding todos
        -> Resolved 
            -> Reason : Use `await` before a promisified function
    -> Problem in update Todo functionality 
        -> Put an eye on capital and small letters of variables
    -> Problem in removeUser
    -> Resolved


# Frontend 
 ## Coding...
    -> Problem While runnng `npm run dev`
        -> Resolved using 
            `npm install @vitejs/plugin-react`
    -> Setted up Frontend
    -> Completed frontend upto User's addtodo functionality

## Break Point 
    I stopped here because i faced problems while i was fetching data back from the server and the call goes to the server
    every runtime which causes the infinite loop and a load to the sever may be i need to know some more about 
    this in the upcoming days.. `useEffect` things and `react Hooks`
    Do this when you are fully aware of integrating bothe the Frontend and Backend ..

    -> Moving on to the rest...
