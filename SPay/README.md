# SPay - A Basic Paytm Clone

**SPay** is a modern web application built with React that simulates a basic Paytm-like platform. This project showcases essential features of a financial application while leveraging a stack of powerful technologies.

## üìú Project Overview

**SPay** allows users to create accounts, manage simulated wallet balances, and transfer virtual money between accounts. It includes features for user authentication, financial transactions, and user search, all presented with a sleek and responsive design. This project is a great example of integrating front-end and back-end technologies to create a functional and user-friendly application.

## üîç Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to their accounts securely using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
- **Simulated Wallet Balance**: Each user has a wallet with a randomly initialized balance, allowing them to experience managing funds.
- **Money Transfers**: Users can transfer simulated money between SPay accounts. The process mimics real-world transactions but does not involve actual money.
- **User Search**: A search bar enables users to find and interact with other SPay accounts.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## üíª Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The core language used for application logic.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to interact with the backend services.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with a modern and flexible CSS framework.
- **Mongoose**: For data modeling and interaction with MongoDB.
